<!-- Web-based application that allows users to track items on Ebay and receive an email notification if that item drops in price. 

There is both a search function and a URL function. If you search, the application uses a headless browser (Chrome) to search the item based on keywords and then grabs the item with web-scraping tools. The URL function will track the item specified.

In Order To Run:
'python3 run/wsgi.py' from the base directory. Currently can only be run from a local machine with chrome driver installed.  -->
